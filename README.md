# Redim-Calc

Calculator to estimate LOX and Ethanol based rocket engine's combustion chamber and nozzle dimensions.
Produces mostly reasonable values, these referring to diameters of nozzle, cross-sectional areas, mass flow rate,
charasteristic velocity and Isp. Other values are very rough estimations.
